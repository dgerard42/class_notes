2d array review, search algorithms, intro to vectors
_____ REVIEW _____
- people writing programs that handle all sorts of integer inputs
- if you change an array in a function, you change it outside too
- arrays are pass by refernece. you cannot return an array from a function. if you change an array
    in a function 
- refernce will always store an address, where a pointer can sometimes store a NULL value
- going to a NULL value pointer will crash the computer (how did I not know this? maybe he means
    attempting to do something with a NULL pointer? because I have definitely used NULL pointer
    if statements in my code, a lot)
- heisenbug - when they don't occur in development enviroment, but do in test enviroment
- off by one errors are the DEVIL
_____ SEARCH ALGOS _____
problem 1
if no length possible
- go thru array
- check each element and check if 137, if 137 then return true
if length possible
- divide in half. check to see if equal
- if not, check left and right to see which closer
- divide that side in half
- and so on
- binary search
