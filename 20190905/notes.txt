- semantic error vs syntacic error, semantic will not be caught by the
    compiler, ie x = 4 is true, but is not the logical comparison that you
    are probably looking to do.
- don't forget your return zeroes
- for (int counter = 0; counter < 10; counter++){}
- you can't access the counter from outside the for loop
- if you declare a variable within braces of a while loop, or and if
    statement you can't use that variable anywhere else in the program
    that's called scope, you know, SCOPE THAT THING YOU KEPT GETTING
    COMPILER ERRORS FOR FOREVER WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING
- 42's programming rules taught you how to avoid scope errors without
    actually understanding scope. rules such as, declare all variables at
    the top of functions, don't reuse variable names
- if you know how many times the code will repeat, use a for loop
- when you don't know how long the code will run for, use while loop
