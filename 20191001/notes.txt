- this_style is the C style
- thisStyle is C++ and therefore we will have to use it in this class going forward... ugh
- other style guidelines are good
_____GENERAL STYLE GUIDELINE NOTES_____
- don't initialize your variable on one line and then assign it on another line. It isn't 1984
    anymore gramps
- but still declare your variables at the top of the code
- declaration of local variables separated from the body of a function by a newline
- this way is actually the old school unix way vvvv
    if(thing){
        hewo;
    }else{
        hi;
    }
    int     main(){
                             <<<---- space here
    variables here;
    }
