- call by value - when you call a new function, and you pass parameters which get assigned values by previous function
- if you have if else statements, all cases must return a variable
- once you return, you leave the entire function
- you are actually supposed to use return keyword at end of void functions, you just don't return anything
- functional decomposition - breaking your code up into its component parts
- main function should look like table of contents
