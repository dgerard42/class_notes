- bitwise or 01 | 10 become 11

- C++ evaluates from left to right, and as soon as something in the
    conditional statement is false, it stops evaluating and doesn't bother
    with the rest of it
- You can make safety checks in your conditional statements, even if they
    are all sameline
- for example :
    if (denominator != 0 && (numerator / denominator) == 2)
    {
        do stuff;
    }
