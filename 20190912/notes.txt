- TABLE OF CONTENTS AS MAIN
- we don't know how any of this stuff is getting done, but it
    will be done in the functions
- cout << static_cast<string>"hewo".length << endl;
- magic numbers are shit. what's a magic number? it's when you
    have weird, random numbers in your code that don't have
    declared variable names. use const ints
- you can only initialize const at the top, and also u gotta
    assign a value
- you're supposed to use ALL_CAPS with underscores 
- there is a school of thought that states that there should be
    only one return statement per function but there reasoning
    is only "becuz it will be neater"
- stanford is The Bad Place
- global variables are bad and will cause bugs
- HOWEVER you CAN use global const variables
- refactoring == changing your program not because you are
    trying to change the code but just because yuo want to make
    it clearer, easier to read and change in the future
