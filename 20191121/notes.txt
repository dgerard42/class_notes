- header file includes safety
    #prgna once
    OR
    ifdef shit vvv
    #include <iostream>
    #ifndef IOSTREAM_H
    #define IOSTREAM_H
    #endif

- for includes, you use <> for libraries that are part of the c++ standard and ""
    for things that are not in the standard
- "this" is a keyword that allows you to access the data in this instance of the
    object, and not some other random variable by the same name
        
void Clock::getTime(int &hr, int &min, int &sec) const {
    hr = this->hr;
    min = this->min;
    sec = this->sec;
}

- class defines what the object is like, object is an instance of the class
- one constructor takes arguements, the other does not
- default constructor - no arguements
- other constructors names are defined by the number of arguments they accept
    ie "the 2 parameter constructor"
- member varaible == instance variables
- variables in struct are public by default, variables in object are private by default
- functions that change values inside the object (mutator or setter)
- functions that get values inside objects (acessor or getter)
